# 📘 Live Markdown Playground

A lightweight, single-page web application that lets you write Markdown and see a live preview in HTML. Built with React + TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and powered entirely in the browser via IndexedDB.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Real-time Markdown Preview**

  - Instant conversion of Markdown to sanitized HTML on every keystroke.
  - Optimized using `remark`, `rehype`, and `unified`.

- ⚡ **Dynamic Parser Loading**

  - Markdown parser libraries are lazily loaded using `import()`.
  - Improves initial bundle size and page load performance.

- 🗂️ **Sample Documents**

  - Includes `intro.md`, `features.md`, and `usage.md`.
  - Users can load samples via a dropdown selector.

- 🌗 **Theme Toggle**

  - Light/Dark mode toggle using Tailwind's `dark:` variants.
  - User preference is persisted with IndexedDB.

- 💾 **Document Persistence**

  - Last-edited Markdown is saved in IndexedDB (`documents` table).
  - Automatically loaded on page refresh.

- 📱 **Responsive Layout**

  - Editor and preview panes side-by-side on desktop.
  - Stacked vertically on mobile screens.
